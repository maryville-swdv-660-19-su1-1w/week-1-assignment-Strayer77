# Week 1 HW - Name Plotter

Uses the python library 'random_name' to generate a list of 5 random names and then gets the character length for each name. It then takes those names and their corresponding character length and the library 'Pygal' creates a bar graph that displays that information which is then rendered in the browser. 

## Usage

Within the 'dist' folder is the executable file: 'Week1HW_NamePlot. Open the file and it will automatically run and create your list of names and render the corresponding graph.
